# Montana License Lookup

**Author:** Jace Claassen  

## Overview

MontanaLicenseLookup is a Java program that allows users to:  

- Lookup county information by license plate prefix.  
- Lookup license plate prefix by city name.  
- If the user enters a city that is not already in the data, the program prompts for its license plate prefix and automatically adds it to the CSV file for future lookups.
